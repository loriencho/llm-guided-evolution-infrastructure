Point Cloud Classification Optimization
#######################################

********
Overview
********

How to get started and setup your system for Point Cloud Classification Team

    In Morris, Jurado, and Zutty's recent paper "LLM Guided Evolution -- The Automation of Models Advancing Models",
    they were able to create a framework that uses LLMs with a layer of creativity to speed up the process of evolving ML models.
    Our specific goal is to generalize this framework by improving 2 current state of the start point cloud classification models.
    We picked Point Transformers and PointNet++ along with the Model40Net DataSet.

==================
Point Transformers
==================

    Point Transformers improves point cloud processing by using self-attention mechanisms, similar to those in transformer models for sequential data.
    They apply attention to capture relationships between all points in the cloud, allowing the model to focus on relevant features and dependencies, both locally and globally, leading to better handling of irregular, unordered data.
    For our purposes we're not using the EMADE Repo instead we'll be using the Large Language Model Guide Evolution Repo.

==========
PointNet++
==========

    PointNet++ extends PointNet by using a hierarchical approach to capture local geometric patterns in 3D point clouds. 
    It samples and groups points into neighborhoods, applies PointNet-style operations to each group, and then propagates the learned features to progressively capture both local and global structures.

=======================
PACE ICE Configurations
=======================

    Training & evaluating models takes a significant amount of computing power which your computers alone may not be able to handle. Which is why this semester we will make great use of PACE ICE.

**What is PACE ICE?**

    PACE stands for Partnership for an Advanced Computing Environment, while ICE is the Instructional Cluster Environment. 

    ICE provides students and instructors with a high-performance computing environment for courses, including those in the College of Computing. 

    It's a free resource for instructional purposes. 

**Important Links**

    The Georgia Tech VPN, specifically the GlobalProtect VPN, is a secure network connection that allows users to access Georgia Tech resources and services from off-campus.

    `GATECH VPN <https://vpn.gatech.edu/global-protect/login.esp>`_

    **username** : gatech username - without @gatech.edu

    **password** : gatech account password

    .. image:: point_cloud_resources/vpn.png

    - You can access any website through the VPN through the ``enter url`` dropdown.

    .. image:: point_cloud_resources/enter_url.png

    - Enter in the pace-ice link: `<https://ondemand-ice.pace.gatech.edu/>`_

    .. note::
        You must be on the vpn to access pace.
    
    - You screen will be redirected to the pace-ice landing page.

    - Head back to the home page, and click on ``My Interactive Session``.

    .. image:: point_cloud_resources/pace-ice-vscode-interactive-sessions.png

    - WHen you click on the Interactive Sessions button at the top of the page, it will redirect to 
    another page that displays every current running session. 

    - The Session you just ceated has been added to the queue, one the appropiate resoruces are avaliable PACE ICE
    will let you connect and load in the session in VSCode's Web Applicaton.

    - Once you're in VSCode, simply click ``File -> Open Folder``, and go to the directory you saved the LLMGE Repo in your scratch or whichever folder.
 
    .. image:: point_cloud_resources/pace-ice-scratch-folder-directory.png

    - Before we begin integrating different architectures into LLMGE, I want to explain the codebase itself how it works, what we're trying to optimize, and our expected results.
    
=====================================
Large Language Model Guided Evolution 
=====================================

    - Large Language Model Guided Evolution is an innovative architecture that leverages the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models to guide evolutionary search and refinement of neural network architectures. 
    
    - The system combines natural language reasoning, feedback-based learning, and genetic optimization techniques to automatically discover and improve neural architectures.

-------------------
 Codebase Breakdown
-------------------
   
    - The codebase is organized into several key directories and files, each serving specific functions in the evolutionary process:

    .. image:: point_cloud_resources/llm-ge-code-base-structure.png

    **sota**

        - sota (State of the Art) directory holds various key information we need for LLMGE to run smoothly.
        - Model Architectures: Houses the baseline neural network architectures targeted for evolutionary improvement
        - Dataset Configurations: Contains dataset specifications and preprocessing scripts
        - Training Scripts: Includes standardized training procedures and evaluation protocols

    **src**

        - The main source directory contains the core configuration files:

        - Large Language Model Configuration, Specific Directories, and Dataset paths


    **constants.py**
        
        - Centralized configuration file containing system parameters, hyperparameters, and global constants.

        .. image:: point_cloud_resources/constants-py-info-1.png

        - Seed network, data files, and train file path directories listed above for global access throughout codebase.
        
        .. image:: point_cloud_resources/constants-py-info-2.png

        - Large Language Model Configuration, along with Evolutionary Alogirthm predefined configurations, population size, number of generations, and weights.

    **templates**

        - The templates sirectory houses validation and code modification templates prompt and code generation templates used by the LLM.

        - There are a wide variety of different prompts we submit to the LLM, we have the variant templates which request for modifications to the submitted SEED file.

        - There is also a validation prompt that helps with cleaning code received from LLM, invalid syntax, unfinshed responses, invalid packages.


    **llm_crossover.py**

        .. image:: point_cloud_resources/llmge-llm-crossover-augment-network.png

    *Download Dataset*
    
        - ExquisiteNetV2, a Lightweight CNN designed for image classification, tested on 15 datasets \(CIFAR-10, MNIST\) with 518,230 parameters, achieving 99.71% accuracy on MNIST. 
    
        -  Go into the sota (State of the art) directory and click on the ExquisiteNetV2 directory.
        
        - Inside this directory you will see a README.md file which contains key information for the dataset.

        .. code-block:: markdown

            # Train Cifar-10
            The best weight has been in the directory `weight/exp`.

            If you want to reproduce the result, you can follow the procedure below.
            - __Download the cifar-10 from https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
            1. Download python version and unzip it.
            2. Put `split.py` into the directory `cifar-10-python`  
         
                `python split.py`
                
                Now you get the cifar10 raw image in the directory `cifar10`

        - Click the link to go to the cifar10 website
        

        .. image:: point_cloud_resources/exquisite-net-v2-dataset-py.png

        - Make sure to sleect the **CIRFAR-10 python version** Link

        .. image:: point_cloud_resources/exquisite-net-v2-dataset-py-2.png
        
        - It will download the cifar-10-python.tar file to your computer
        
        .. image:: point_cloud_resources/exquisite-net-v2-dataset-py-3.png

        - Once you click on it you will see another ciar-10-bathces-py folder

        - Make sure you extact the contents of cifar-10-python.tar to your computer

        - Then head on over to the PACE ICE Instructional Cluster, then drag & drop the file into the ExquisteNetV2 directory

        .. image:: point_cloud_resources/exquisite-net-v2-dataset-py-4.png

        - Once the file is there you will run 

        .. code-block:: markdown

            `python split.py`

        - This command will format the cifar-10-bathces-py folder and create another directory called cifar-10, with the test and train data.

                
    *Constants.py*

        .. image:: point_cloud_resources/exquisite-net-v2-constants-py-1.png

        - root directory is the path to LLMGE folder **/home/hice1/madewolu9/scratch/llm-guided-evolution/**

        - data path is the path to the sota model dataset **ExquisiteNetV2/cifar10**
         
        - sota path is the (state of the art) model path **ExquisiteNetV2/**

        - seed network is the main model file for the SOTA model **ExquiteNetV2/network.py**

        - model variable is the name of the SEED network file without .py **network**

        - train file path is the path to the train.py file used within the SOTA model.

        .. image:: point_cloud_resources/exquisite-net-v2-constants-py-2.png

        - llm_model specifies which Large Language Model you intend to use either one of the localy provided ones on PACE ICE, or Google's Gemini via an API key.
        

        - Further down you can see the Evolution Cosntants/Params 

        - This is where you can configure the number of elites, total num_generations, starting generation and population size. 


**Evolutionary Loop**

    .. image:: point_cloud_resources/run-improved-individual-deap.png
        
    - We initialize the toolbox which holds the key methods we plan to use during the evolutionary loop.

    .. image:: point_cloud_resources/run-improved-individual-creation.png

    - This is essentially the main method within run_imrpoved that starts the model evolution. 
    - We create our population and configure key parameters to our specification. 

**Variant Model Files**

    **Local Large Language Model Setup**

    - For LLMGE to create the variant files and valid code we have to setup the Large Language Model.
    - There are 3 files where changes need to be made, constants, server, & llm_utils.py.

    *constants.py*

        - Within the constants.py file make sure to set the LLM_MODEL global variable to the LLM of your choice.
        - You can use  **mixtral**, **llama**, and even **gemini** (provide your gemini API key)
        
        .. code-block:: markdown

            `os.environ["GEMINI_API_KEY"]` = ""

    *server.py*

    - Inside of server.py make sure to set the LLM Model Path to the **MODEL_PATH** variable.

    - All Locally downloaded LLM's are located on PACE ICE, at **/storage/ice-shared/vip-vvk/llm_storage/choose-your-llm** (You may need to cd .. a few times)

    .. image:: point_cloud_resources/llmge-server-configure.png

    .. code-block:: markdown

        `MODEL_PATH = /storage/ice-shared/vip-vvk/llm_storage/mixtral`

    *llm_utils.py*

  
    - llm_utils essentially deals with generating the code from the LLM, we submit a request and get a generated reponse in return.

    - However, before any request is sent we have to check the **LLM_MODEL** along with the **code_generator**

    .. image:: point_cloud_resources/llmge-llm-utils-configure.png

    - The code generator varies with whichever LLM_MODEL you plan to use.
    
    - If you pick mixtral, make sure to set **code_generator** to **submit_mixtral_local**, do the same for each respective **LLM_MODEL**

    .. image:: point_cloud_resources/create-individual-run-improved.png

    - The **create_individual method** takes the seed file which has been generically integrated and creates a varaint file with a unique geneId -> **model_xXPAsb8bdabdyuv28f.py** in a sub-directory called llmge_models, which will be submitted for evaluation.

**Seed individuals**

    .. image:: point_cloud_resources/llmge-env-network-py.png

    - Seed individuals are created at the very start **(generation_0)**, using the LLM to make modifications to the main model file **network.py** inside of EquisteNetV2.

**Fitness Evaluation**

    - **submit_run** takes in the gene_id associated with a unique model variant file.

    - We take the **TRAIN_FILE** that we defined inside of the **constants.py** file and use it to train the seed_files in the **llmge_models** directory.

    - We include the appropiate parameters, for each respective sota model, and finally create the python runline to evaluate the model.

    .. image:: point_cloud_resources/llmge-evaluation-network.png

    - Then we wait for jobs that were submitted, and assign the fitness to the variant model files.
    - We take the model_variant files and evaluate them using the train.py file for the model architecture.
    - The results are stored in a textfile within a directory called **/results**.

    .. code:: markdown

       `f"{test_acc},{total_params},{val_acc},{tr_time}"`
       `fitness = [float(r.strip()) for r in results]`

       # TODO: get all features later (test_accuracy, total_params)

       `fitness = [fitness[0], fitness[1]] `
       `fitness = tuple(fitness)`

**Selection**   

    .. image:: point_cloud_resources/llmge-elites-code.png

    - Next We choose the best individuals **(elites)** and select for reproduction.
    - Choose the elities to use in the next generation, default **#elites** is 10.

**Crossover**

    .. image:: point_cloud_resources/llmge-crossover-code.png

    - We perform a crossover, we combine code/parameters from two models to create offspring.
    - Pairs of individuals are selected.
    - For each pair, a crossover operation is performed:
    - Combine elements **(code segments, parameters)** from both parents, often with LLM assistance/templates.
    - Create a new gene ID, generate new code **(as a Python file)**, and submit a new job.
    - The new individual **(“offspring”)** is tracked.

**Mutation**

    .. image:: point_cloud_resources/llmge-custom-mutation.png

    - Randomly alter code/parameters in a model to create a mutant
    - Each individual has a chance **(with some probability)** to be mutated:
    - Change hyperparameters **(input_filename, output_filename, template_txt, top_p, temperature, ...) (again, often LLM-guided)**.
    - Create a new gene ID, generate new code, submit a new training job.
    - Track the mutated individual.

**Next Generation** 

    .. image:: point_cloud_resources/llmge-new-generation.png

    -  Build new population, remove duplicates, keep elites
    - The next generation’s population is composed of:
    - Elites (best models from the previous generation)
    - Offspring from crossover/mutation
    - Duplicates are removed to ensure diversity

    - Then save the dataset in `data/modelnet40_normal_resampled/`

**Constants.py**

    .. image:: point_cloud_resources/pointnet-constants.png
    - This shows us what is needed from the model for it to run:
        - ROOT_DIR: sets the location of where our framework is located
        - DATA_PATH: sets the location of where our data is located, for people using PACE-ICE the location is already preset so they can save storage

**pointnet_cls_ssg.py**

    - Restructed the format for how this file works, the original implementation had all the necessary methods and classes needed for augmentation in a separate file which was useful for the author of this model to just call the file and import the needed methods and classes
    - To restructure, I copied all necessary methods and classes from pointnet_utils.py that were called in pointnet_cls_ssg.py so the LLM will know which methods and classes need to be augmented
    - Restructured Code:
        - square_distance(src, dst): finds the pairwise squared Euclidean distance between two sets of points
        - index_points(points, idx): indexes a set of points using their provided indicies
        - farthest_point_sample(xyz, npoint): a method of sampling to select well spaced points
        - query_ball_point(radius, nsample, xyz, new_xyz): finds a ball of certain radius centered at sampled points
        - sample_and_group(npoint, radius, nsample, xyz, points, returnfps=False): uses the above methods to give each sampled point a local grouping
